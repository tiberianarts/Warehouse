Mandar is a remote ice planet. Once an observation post and scientific research center for the Mandarians, it has long since been all but abandoned. The remaining inhabitants are little more than scavengers, thieves, and warlords. There are villages scattered throughout the landscape, though most of them are suspicious and violent towards outsiders.
